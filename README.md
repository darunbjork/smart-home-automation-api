# Smart Home Automation API

## üè† Project Overview

This is the backend API for a smart home automation system. It is built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, with a MongoDB database. The API provides a secure and scalable foundation for managing users, households, devices, and a multi-tenant invitation system.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and token-based access control.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Robust data isolation ensuring users only access resources (households, devices) they have permission for.
- **Device Management:** A flexible API for creating, updating, and controlling smart home devices.
- **Household Management:** An invitation-based system for adding and managing household members.
- **Data Integrity:** Cascading deletions and atomic transactions to prevent orphaned data.
- **Real-Time Communication (WebSockets):** Instantaneous updates of device statuses and other events to connected clients.
- **IoT Integration (MQTT):** Seamless communication with physical smart home devices for sending commands and receiving status updates.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/smart-home-automation-api.git
    cd smart-home-automation-api
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
    ```ini
    PORT=3000
    NODE_ENV=development
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smart-home-db
    JWT_SECRET= # Your JWT secret key
    JWT_REFRESH_SECRET= # Your JWT refresh secret key
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=1h
    REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=7d
    LOG_LEVEL=debug
    ```
    (Note: `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` should be long, random strings for production.)

### Running the Project

The project is configured to run using Docker Compose, which will spin up the Node.js API, an embedded MQTT broker, and a MongoDB instance.

1.  **Build and run the containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images and start the services. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the MQTT broker will be accessible on port `1883`.

### Running Locally (without Docker Compose for API)

You can also run the API directly on your machine, connecting to a local or Dockerized MongoDB instance.

1.  **Ensure MongoDB is running:**
    If you're using Docker Compose for MongoDB, start it:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d mongo
    ```
2.  **Start the API:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:prod
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

To run the unit and integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger and is available at:

`http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

This interactive UI allows you to explore all endpoints, test them directly, and understand the API's structure.

### MQTT Integration Testing

To test the MQTT integration, you'll need to simulate an IoT device.

1.  **Start the API:** Ensure your Docker containers are running:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
2.  **Prepare a Device:** Register a user and create a device via the API (e.g., using Postman). Note down the `householdId` and `deviceId`.
3.  **Run the Device Simulator:**
    *   Update `mqtt-device-simulator.js` with your `HOUSEHOLD_ID` and `DEVICE_ID`.
    *   Run the simulator in a new terminal:
        ```bash
        node mqtt-device-simulator.js
        ```
4.  **Send a Command:** Update the device's `data` via the API (e.g., `PATCH /devices/:deviceId`).
    *   **Expected:** The simulator terminal should show it received the command and published a status update.
5.  **Verify Status Update:** Check your `client.html` browser console. You should see a `device:update` event with the device's status changed to `online`.
